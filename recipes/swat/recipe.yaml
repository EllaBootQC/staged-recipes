  summary: 'Python interface to SAS Cloud Analytic Services engine.'
  description: |
    The SAS SWAT package is a Python interface to the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) engine (the centerpiece of the SAS Viya framework). With this package, you can load and analyze data sets of any size on your desktop or in the cloud. Since CAS can be used on a local desktop or in a hosted cloud environment, you can analyze extremely large data sets using as much processing power as you need, while still retaining the ease-of-use of Python on the client side.
